# Manifesto

> **"You don't know it until you model it."**

## 1. The Ladder of Cognition

Modeling is not about writing documentation; it is the materialization of cognition. It involves five progressive steps:

1. **Recognize**: Deliver **Boolean**.
   - Acknowledge the existence of a concept or entity.
2. **Name**: Deliver **String**.
   - Assign a unique reference name (Handle) to the concept.
3. **Describe**: Deliver **Text/List**.
   - list its attributes, characteristics, and relationships with other concepts.
4. **Schematize**: Deliver **Struct (Pydantic)**.
   - Transform the description into a strict structure understandable by computers, defining the shape of the data.
5. **Normalize**: Deliver **Predicate (Pytest)**.
   - Define validation logic and test assertions to ensure the integrity of the truth.

## 2. Role: The Literate Engineer

Constrained by the professional division of labor in the industrial age, humans often only handle one link in the above chain. PMs are responsible for description, architects for schematization, and developers for normalization.

**The emergence of AI makes the return of the "Da Vinci-style" polymath possible.**

To harness this power, we need a new professional paradigm: **The Literate Engineer**.

- **Literate**: We retain the expressive power of natural language, using Markdown to carry the flow and ambiguity of thought.
- **Engineering**: We introduce engineering discipline, anchoring the boundaries of truth with Schema and Tests.

Engineering itself implies **discipline** and **constraints**. Typedown is not just a documentation tool; it is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) built for the Literate Engineer.

## 3. Dialectic: Freedom via Constraint

Why does Typedown introduce "Fragile References", "Strict Schemas", and "Physical Fields"?

Because **Leverage comes from Constraints**.

- **This is an exchange**: You deliver the **constraint** of "adhering to Schema" in exchange for the **leverage** of AI "generating 100 logical test cases".
- **This is the price**: You deliver the **discipline** of "explicitly handling reference paths" in exchange for the **freedom** of the Compiler "instantly pointing out all logical breaks during refactoring".

True freedom is not doing whatever you want (that is chaos), but having the ability to control complex systems (that is mastery).

By **Formalizing Thought**, we hand over the tedious drudgery of "form" to tools and AI, thereby releasing the core value of humans—**orchestrating creative thinking in the highest dimension**.

This is Typedown's promise: **Exchange the strictest constraints for the ultimate cognitive freedom.**
